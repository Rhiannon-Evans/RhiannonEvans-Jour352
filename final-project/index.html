                    <h4>
                        Craig Coyner’s descent onto the streets of Bend, Ore., came after decades spent fighting as a
                        lawyer and politician for those on the edge of society.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        BEND, Ore. — As he navigated one day last fall through a crowded grid of beds at one of Oregon’s
                        largest homeless shelters, Steve Martin, a longtime rancher and community volunteer, was brought
                        to a halt by a familiar voice that called out from an unfamiliar face.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Aren’t you going to say, ‘Hi,’ Steve?” said the man, with eyes peering through curtains of
                        white hair and a beard that flared in neglected disarray. Mr. Martin, who spent many of his days
                        working among the shelter’s residents, considered the man’s gaunt frame, searching for a clue.
                        Then the man spoke again: “It’s Craig.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The words jolted Mr. Martin with a mix of recognition and disbelief. He had known Craig Coyner
                        for more than 50 years, watching with admiration as the man from one of the most prominent
                        families in Bend, Ore., rose through an acclaimed career — as a prosecutor, a defense lawyer and
                        then a mayor who helped turn the town into one of the nation’s fastest-growing cities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, at age 75, Mr. Coyner was occupying a bed at the shelter on Second Street, his house lost
                        to foreclosure, his toes gnarled by frostbite, his belongings limited to a tub of tattered
                        clothing and books on the floor next to his bed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the years since the two old friends had fallen out of touch, Mr. Coyner had been pulled
                        through a vortex of the same crises that were churning through many boom towns across the West:
                        untreated mental illness, widespread addiction, soaring housing costs and a waning sense of
                        community. After a life spent as a pillar of Bend’s civic life, Mr. Coyner had somehow reached a
                        point of near total destitution, surrounded by the prosperity he had helped create.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once a tiny timber town, Bend had undergone a striking transformation in recent decades, as
                        moneyed newcomers from Seattle or Portland or San Francisco discovered a getaway that managed to
                        be both trendy and a throwback to what everyone imagines small-town America can be. Families
                        could float the Deschutes River in the summer and ski the Cascades in the winter, stopping at an
                        array of craft breweries, organic eateries, art galleries and — a point of special pride for the
                        city — the last Blockbuster video store on Earth.

                    <p>
                        But as housing costs strained the budgets of Bend’s nurses, teachers and police officers,
                        homelessness soared in the city of 100,000 people, much as it had in far larger West Coast
                        cities. RVs started parking on side streets; people with full-time jobs at gas stations and
                        grocery stores at times went home to tents erected in the sagebrush along street medians. The
                        shelter where Mr. Coyner had finally found refuge had been over capacity for months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Martin’s mind raced with questions for Mr. Coyner, as he wondered what had transpired in the
                        years since they last connected and how Mr. Coyner’s life could have taken such a drastic turn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the next couple of months, he would pick up Mr. Coyner from the shelter from time to time,
                        and they would go out for drives. They stopped to get Mr. Coyner an overdue haircut at King’s
                        Razor. They grabbed coffee at the 7-Eleven. They sat out by the municipal airport, watching the
                        private planes come and go while reminiscing about their long-ago efforts to save the airstrip
                        from closure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They talked more about the future than the past, with Mr. Coyner wondering how he could find a
                        more permanent place to live.
                    </p>
                    <p>“He was real discouraged that he would never find anything,” Mr. Martin said.</p>
                    <p>
                        But Mr. Coyner was also starting to regain the optimism that had long defined his view of the
                        city. Plenty of people in Bend were going through hard times, he said in an interview earlier
                        this year when he talked about the arc of his life. He had seen them overcome such times before,
                        and they would do so again. So would he.

                        <p class="name">- Craig Coyner, Former mayor of Bend, OR.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>A Mayor During Turmoil</h2>
                    <p>Mr. Coyner was born into a family committed to civic duty.</p>
                    <p>
                        In the early 1900s, his great-grandfather was mayor of Bend, then a newly incorporated outpost
                        in central Oregon where timber prospectors were scooping up forestlands. Before long, a
                        community once known as a place to ford the river was a key stop on a growing railroad network.
                        Some of the largest pine mills in the world processed logs so massive that some first needed to
                        be split by dynamite.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By the mid-1970s, after getting drafted for a stint in the Marines, marrying his girlfriend from
                        college and getting a law degree in Portland, Mr. Coyner returned to Bend, following his father
                        into a career as a lawyer and settling into a compact one-story home, purchased for $25,500 in
                        the northeast corner of town.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The couple had two daughters but split up a few years later, as Mr. Coyner, still building his
                        legal career, at times grew combative at home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Itching to spar over the wonkiest legal doctrines, he commanded such a depth of knowledge and a
                        skill for arguing that he kept notching victories for clients and frustrating the local
                        prosecutors, who decided the best course of action was to hire Mr. Coyner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I thought he’d be better working in our office — working for us, rather than against us,” said
                        Mike Dugan, who was in the county prosecutor’s office and later became the district attorney.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1981, Mr. Coyner, who cut a figure around town with his tortoiseshell glasses and calculator
                        watch, joined the City Council. He married Patty Davis, who worked selling radio advertising
                        around Bend, and as his former wife also remarried, he stopped connecting with his daughters.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 1984, his fellow council members elected him as mayor.</p>
                    <p>
                        It was a time of tumult for the city. The global recession had gutted the timber industry, with
                        less wood product going to customers around the world and more covering up windows in Bend’s
                        empty business district. Locals feared the community was on the path to becoming a ghost town.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Homeless people congregated along the railroad tracks that had helped establish Bend as a timber
                        capital. On cold nights, rail crews would deliberately leave some of their idle train cars open,
                        providing a modest refuge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Coyner worked with Mr. Martin to raise funds for them, at times going out to the railroad
                        tracks himself to distribute donated clothes and 19-cent cheeseburgers picked up from the local
                        Arctic Circle. His connections helped people find cheap places to live at a time when rooms
                        could be rented for as little as $75 a month.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Mr. Coyner saw it as a time to transition Bend’s economy to something that would harness the
                        surrounding natural beauty in new ways, welcoming visitors who sought to ski, hike, camp and
                        bike.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He and fellow council members began drawing up plans to expand the sewer system and improve road
                        capacity. Kathie Eckman, one of the council members at the time, said there was excitement but
                        also uncertainty.
                    </p>
                    <p>“We were warned at that point: Be careful what you wish for,” Ms. Eckman said.</p>
                    <h2>New Directions</h2>
                    <p>
                        The timber mills were shutting down, but the old mill district began evolving into what today is
                        a ritzy shopping district with an REI, a spa and a designer jewelry store.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some people were wary of such swift change, and in 1992, Mr. Coyner was ousted from the City
                        Council by rivals seeking to rein in growth. It did not work: Over the subsequent decade, the
                        county’s population grew faster than anywhere else in the state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Coyner returned to his work as a defense lawyer, and he regularly reminded younger peers
                        about the importance of continuing to fight for those who were less fortunate. He spoke about
                        health care and transportation and poverty and all the other factors that might lead someone to
                        commit a crime.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “He would say, ‘To be effective at that job as a public defender, you have to fight for
                        solutions to the problems that would cause your defendants to get involved in the criminal
                        justice system in the first place,’” said John Hummel, who joined the public defender’s office
                        in 1996 and later became district attorney.

                    <p class="credit">Bend Bulletin, via Deschutes County Historical Society</p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Coyner had long been a personable, intelligent lawyer who got along with judges and clients,
                        said Tom Crabtree, who was the head of the public defender’s office at the time. But in later
                        years, Mr. Crabtree said he watched as Mr. Coyner’s amiable nature started to grow caustic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Judges began to report concerns about Mr. Coyner’s work and conduct. The office altered his job
                        duties to try and ease his travel schedule. But the concerns kept compounding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a judge removed him from a case one day, Mr. Coyner’s startling outburst in the courtroom
                        led Mr. Crabtree to decide it was time to terminate Mr. Coyner, who responded, he said, with a
                        death threat.
                    </p>
                    <p>For several days, Mr. Crabtree wore a bulletproof vest to work.</p>
                    <h2>A Series of Losses</h2>
                    <p>
                        The underlying problem was an emerging bipolar disorder, Mr. Coyner said, compounded because he
                        had turned to drinking as a way to cope.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the day after Thanksgiving in 2003, a few years after losing his job, Mr. Coyner was
                        arrested, accused of damaging a woman’s car and resisting a police officer. The state bar
                        suspended his license in response to complaints that he was neglecting duties to his clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>Then, in 2008, came the worst blow of all: His wife, Patty, died after an illness.</p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Coyner had already pushed others out of his life, not only his daughters, but his sister,
                        who had started to distance herself when late-night drunken phone calls had turned abusive.
                        After Patty died, his brother came to check on him, but Mr. Coyner did not seem to want him
                        there.

                    <p>
                        Police encounters twice led him to being placed briefly in psychiatric care, and he struggled to
                        get his life back on track.

                    <p>
                        But he managed to find a connection with a new friend, Cheraphina Edwards. They had met at a
                        local saloon, and she later brought him a DVD of a film produced by the conspiracist Alex Jones
                        about how global elites were advancing a secret plan to exterminate much of humanity. Mr. Coyner
                        was enthralled, Ms. Edwards said, and as she moved in with him to serve as a caregiver, the two
                        began discussing Mr. Coyner’s theories that powerful figures in Bend were plotting to kill him.

                    <p>
                        Even then, Mr. Coyner was regularly welcoming people who had lost their housing to stay at his
                        small house, or out in the yard. Some days, he would go down to the Bend Community Center, which
                        served daily meals to the needy, arriving early to help set up coffee or staying late to wash
                        dishes.

                        But without a job, he was falling behind on his mortgage, and the bank began foreclosure
                        proceedings in 2012.

                        Mr. Coyner had worked in prior years to help others facing foreclosure, and he resisted his own
                        fate vehemently. Still, by 2017, the police were closing in on plans to evict him. Mr. Coyner
                        had warned an agent at the mortgage company that the only thing the banks would receive from him
                        was a “burnt house with a body inside,” one officer wrote in an email at the time to his
                        colleagues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When deputies eventually removed Mr. Coyner from the house, he and Ms. Edwards found few living
                        options in a changed city. Rents had jumped 40 percent in five years. Many people who had lived
                        in town their whole lives could no longer afford to live there, he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Coyner and Ms. Edwards crashed for a bit on a friend’s couch. They spent other times
                        sleeping in a truck, parked in the woods next to a golf course. Eventually, they heard about an
                        abandoned cabin in the nearby community of La Pine, driving out to find that it looked more like
                        a shed and would require them to bathe from water heated on a wood stove.

                    <p>
                        “It was so tiny, it scared me,” Ms. Edwards said. “I put it in reverse, and Craig said, ‘No,
                        we’re going to have to live here.’”

                    <h2>New Connections</h2>
                    <p>
                        On a spring day in 2018, Mr. Coyner was walking near the hospital in Bend when a woman stopped
                        him.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Craig?” the woman asked.</p>
                    <p>“You’re my daughter,” he said with a shock of recognition.</p>
                    <p>
                        It was Catherine Emick, one of the daughters he had not seen since she was a teenager. Now, she
                        was 40. They exchanged phone numbers and made plans to meet again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was the beginning of a slow reconciliation. One day, they met for drinks. She sipped a
                        lemonade; he had a beer. Soon, he was beginning to reconnect with his other daughter, Elizabeth
                        Smith. But he never asked for help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By then, the coronavirus pandemic had heightened awareness of the attractive, small-town life
                        that Bend offered, and remote workers with lucrative salaries were scooping up homes. The median
                        home price jumped to nearly $800,000, with houses often snapped up by all-cash buyers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Coyner found himself camping sometimes in a tent along the Parkway, the road he had helped
                        get built to prepare Bend for the growth city leaders had anticipated. Other times, he set up on
                        the property of a group that served homeless veterans — an organization where he was once a
                        board member. Sometimes he would venture near Coyner Trail, a walking path through town named
                        for his family because of all they had done for the city.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He heard a voice inside and pulled back the tent flap. A pungent smell of urine and feces filled
                        the air. Inside, Mr. Coyner’s shoes were soaking wet, his feet so frostbitten he was hobbling
                        with pain when he tried to stand up. When he refused to go to a shelter, Mr. Smalley contacted
                        Ms. Edwards, and she called the police for help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He wound up at the hospital, where he was treated for frostbite, but he was soon discharged to
                        the city’s new low-barrier shelter. It had room for 100 but often had many more sleeping there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I’ve got a lot of company,” Mr. Coyner said in the interview. “Places like this are absolutely
                        necessary.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The frostbite had damaged Mr. Coyner’s toes so badly that he had to go back to the hospital at
                        the end of January for an amputation. There were complications. After the surgery, he had a
                        stroke that left him unable to speak.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Martin came to visit, and so did Ms. Edwards, praying for him. Mr. Coyner lurched forward in
                        joy when Ms. Smith, his daughter, came. She sat for hours, telling him about her life and
                        introducing him to her husband.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I wanted to let him know I’m doing OK,” she said. “I wanted him to know that he wasn’t alone.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When his other daughter, Ms. Emick, held his hand and bowed her head, Mr. Coyner reached over
                        and touched her head. She hugged him, the kind of embrace they had not shared in 35 years. She
                        wondered how the city her father loved had missed so many opportunities to help him.
                    </p>
                    <p>If he had been a dog, she said, somebody would have rescued him long ago.</p>
                    <p>Days later, on Feb. 14, Craig Coyner died.</p>
